CHANGES from version 1.2.1
===============================================================================

Simulation

* Changed simulation algorithm. The new formula is taken from Robocup simulator:
  A = force * ACCEL_FACTOR
  P1 = P0 + U
  U = V0 + A0
  V1 = DECAY * U
  if U > MAX_SPEED then U = MAX_SPEED
  
  Where:
  P - position
  U - speed after acceleration
  V - velocity
  A = acceleration
  1 - next value
  0 - current value (e.g. V1 next speed)
  ACCEL_FACTOR - (0.025 for ball 0.004 for player)
  DECAY - constant (0.94 for ball and 0.4 for player)
  MAX_SPEED constant (3 for ball 0.7 for player)
  
  The simulation looks more realistic this way.

* Added starting scripts for Linux and Win32
* Beta version of Soccer monitor. This monitor can be used to run
  simulation and test AI players.
* Refactored the whole simulation code. Now the simulation 
  and socket communication code is in separate package.
* Players are not allowed to move to opponent side in the pre game mode.
* Player with number 1 is treated as goalkeeper
* Offside is back. 
  Players are marked ofside when team mate passes the ball.
  When any of the marked players kick the ball then game state changes to offside.
  Now the rule works like in real soccer.
* Add collision between ball and players
* I changed player inertia to 1 (default). Of course it can still be changed 
  in properties file. The reson for this is:
 - It doesn't affect simulation speed. 
 - It is a lot easier to write player. The problem with inertia is that client 
   doesn't know when to issue the command. E.g. it is impossible to calculate where to
   intercept ball, because player doesn't know when he will able to kick it.
 - It doesn't affect player speed. To writie good player it is nesessery to send
   command after each visual info.
  
Monitor

* Left clik on the filed moves the ball

  
  
FIXED:
* Fixed position of goal kick, corner kick and throw in
* Fixed bug with deciding kick off side after ball left the field or 
  team scores a goal.
